**Contact:** [levibanks95@gmail.com](mailto:levibanks95@gmail.com)

## Summary
This app connects a custom GPT to **Google Sheets** to publish the *Fibonacci Project Registry* and related logs. We request the minimum scopes needed and use your data **only** to fulfill your direct requests. We do **not** sell or share your data for advertising.

## Permissions Requested
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` (read/write Google Sheets)  
- *Optional:* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` (create/manage files the user opens/creates with the app)

## Data We Access
When you authorize the app, Google may provide:
- Your Google account ID (for OAuth consent)  
- Access tokens to call the **Google Sheets API** on your behalf  
- Spreadsheet metadata and cell contents for the sheets you select/use with the app

## How We Use Data
- Read sheet metadata/values to validate headers and locate tabs
- Write/append/clear ranges to publish the **Project_Registry** and **Change_Log**
- Optionally create sheets/tabs and apply light formatting

We do not use your data for unrelated purposes.

- No data is sold or used for advertising

## Storage & Retention
- Access tokens are handled by the platform hosting the GPT Action and are used only for authenticated API calls
- We do **not** build a server-side database of your sheet contents
- Logs (if any) are used strictly for troubleshooting and are not retained longer than necessary

## Sharing
We do not disclose your Google data to third parties except as required by law or with your explicit direction (e.g., publishing to a sheet you own and share).

## Security
We follow reasonable safeguards and rely on Google’s and the platform’s security for OAuth and API calls. You should only authorize the app from trusted networks/devices.

## Your Choices
- You can revoke access at any time at **Google Account → Security → Third-party access**  
- You can delete files created by the app in Google Drive/Sheets
